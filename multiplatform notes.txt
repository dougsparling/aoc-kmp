multiplatform notes:
- hot code replace didn't work
- iOS kinda painful, but maybe if regularly developing with XCode you wouldn't hit it 
- unicode strings mangled on web
- 20-30GB of shit to download: gradle, xcode, dependencies, simulators, etc.
- String.format and other foundational stdlib just missing, lol
- can call Kotlin from Swift, works with a horrific Obj-C header?
- the other way is horrific unless you're calling some well-known set of swift built-ins
- docs and ability to find answers online generally not very good
- calling across swift/kotlin boundary incurs a significant cost
- Web JS interop is... weird. Kotlin can provide types ala typescript
- don't get string resources out of the box... annoying, but just create strings.xml

issues:

jetbrains seems to be re-implementing android stuff in multiplatform, e.g.:
implementation("org.jetbrains.androidx.navigation:navigation-compose:2.8.0-alpha10")

and following android-specific instructions often leads to ruin, e.g. can't use navigation from jetpack
